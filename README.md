# nlohmann-json-parser-for-mingw
JSON parser for mingw

This is a copy of the modern C++ JSON parser by @nlohmann, release version 2.1.1

It has been edited to replace the std functions that are missing from the code::blocks library distributed with code::blocks
and another compiler error from snprintf.

The original code, documentation and support can be found at https://github.com/nlohmann/json
